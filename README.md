# testing-devin-code-migrations-scala

## Project Introduction
This project is a Scala-based application designed to demonstrate the migration and transformation of code within a legacy system. It utilizes Apache Spark to perform data processing operations, encapsulated within a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure. The legacy code is organized into a series of Spark operation instances, which serve as placeholders or templates for the application's data processing logic.

The main objective of this project is to explore and refactor the legacy Scala code, ensuring that it integrates seamlessly with modern data processing frameworks and practices. This repository serves as a testbed for code migration strategies and performance optimizations in a controlled environment.

Please note that the code within this repository is for demonstration purposes and is part of an ongoing engineering experiment.
